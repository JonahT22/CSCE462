# The time.sleep() works for eliminating jitter since there is a narrow band of possible
# frequencies (1 - 20 Hz).

#2. Find max/min voltages (how?)


#3. Using previous two, use expected function values at specific intervals to determine
# type of function.


#4. Continuously check for frequency, make sure it's on the same function (tolerance = within 0.5 Hz of defined value)
